# Morpho Batching

The [`InitMulticall`](./src/InitMulticall.sol) allows EOAs to batch-execute a sequence of arbitrary calls atomically.
It carries specific features to be able to perform actions that require authorizations, and handle callbacks.

## Structure

### InitMulticall

<img width="586" alt="structure" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983b7e48-ba0c-4fda-a31b-e7c9cc212da4">

The InitMulticall's entrypoint is `multicall(Call[] calldata bundle)`.
A bundle is a sequence of calls where each call is specified by:
- `to`, an address to call;
- `data`, some calldata to pass to the call;
- `value`, an amount of native currency to send with the call;
- `skipRevert`, a boolean indicating whether the multicall should revert if the call failed.

The InitMulticall transiently stores the initial caller (`initiator`) during the multicall (see in the Adapters subsection for the use).

The last non-returned called address can re-enter the InitMulticall using `reenter(Call[] calldata bundle)` (same).

### Adapters

The initMulticall can call either directly protocols, or wrappers of protocols (called "adapters").
Wrappers can be useful to perform â€œatomic checks" (e.g. slippage checks), manage slippage (e.g. in migrations) or perform actions that require authorizations.

In order to be safely authorized by users, adapters can restrict some functions calls depending on the value of the bundle's initiator, stored in the InitMulticall.
For instance, a adapter that needs to hold some token approvals should only allow to call `transferFrom` with from=initiator.

Since these functions can typically move user funds, only the InitMulticall should be allowed to call them.
If a adapter gets called back (e.g. during a flashloan) and needs to perform more actions, it can use other adapters by calling the InitMulticall's `reenter(Call[] calldata bundle)` function.

## Adapters List

All adapters inherit from [`CoreAdapter`](./src/adapters/CoreAdapter.sol), which provides essential features such as accessing the current initiator address.

### [`GeneralAdapter1`](./src/adapters/GeneralAdapter1.sol)

Contains the following actions:
- ERC20 transfers, permit, wrap & unwrap.
- Native token (e.g. WETH) wrap & unwrap.
- ERC4626 mint,deposit, withdraw & redeem.
- Morpho interactions.
- Permit2 approvals.
- URD claim.

### [`EthereumGeneralAdapter1`](./src/adapters/EthereumGeneralAdapter1.sol)

Contains the following actions:
- Actions of `GeneralAdapter1`.
- Morpho token wrapper withdrawal.
- Dai permit.
- StEth staking.
- WStEth wrap & unwrap.

### [`ParaswapAdapter`](./src/adapters/ParaswapAdapter.sol)

Contains the following actions, all using the paraswap aggregator:
- Sell a given amount or the balance.
- Buy a given amount.
- Buy a what's needed to fully repay on a given Morpho Market.

### Migration adapters

For [Aave V2](./src/adapters/migration/AaveV2MigrationAdapter.sol), [Aave V3](./src/adapters/migration/AaveV3MigrationAdapter.sol), [Compound V2](./src/adapters/migration/CompoundV2MigrationAdapter.sol), [Compound V3](./src/adapters/migration/CompoundV3MigrationAdapter.sol), and [Morpho Aave V3 Optimizer](./src/adapters/migration/AaveV3OptimizerMigrationAdapter.sol).

## Differences with [Bundler v2](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue-bundlers)

- Make use of transient storage.
- InitMulticall, unlike bundlers, is a call dispatcher that must not be approved.
  Because call-dispatch and approvals are now separated, it is possible to add adapters over time without additional risk to users of existing adapters.
- All generic features are now in `GeneralAdapter1`, instead of being in separate files that are then all inherited by a single contract.
- All Ethereum related features are in the `EthereumAdapter1` which inherits from `GeneralAdapter1`.
- The `1` after `Adapter` is not a version number: when new features are development we will deploy additional adapters, for instance `GeneralAdapter2`.
  Existing adapters will still be used.
- Many adjustments such as:
  - A value `amount` is only taken to be the current balance (when it makes sense) if equal to `uint.max`
  - Slippage checks are done with a price argument instead of a limit amount.
  - When `shares` represents a supply or borrow position, `shares == uint.max` sets `shares` to the position's total value.
  - There are receiver arguments in all functions that give tokens to the adapter so the adapter can pass along those tokens.
